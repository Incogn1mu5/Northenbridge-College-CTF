5|Flag register has locations and prerequisites but no values.|✅ pass|Register contains only literal NCC{...} values.
6|Reset procedure allows copy-paste and verified.|✅pass|Commands are present and improved with NAT/Bridged curl.Verified on a live VM.

-|-|-|-
1|Stage numbering and names identical across all three documents.| ⚠️ Partial|Instructor uses "Stage 1 — Discover the hidden admin portal"; student uses "Stage 1 — Find the hidden staff area"; learning objectives uses "① Hidden routes are not access control". cross-reference meaning stays same.
